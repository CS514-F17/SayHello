Sample 1 - Say Hello
====================

### Due N/A

The goal of this simple assignment is to write a hello world program that commit it to github correctly. You will use the following programming concepts:

- Methods
- Classes
- Github

### Background

Your first program in any new language will be a program that says hello! 

### Assignment Specification

**API:** You are required to implement the API defined in [`SayHello`](https://github.com/CS514-F17/SayHello/blob/master/src/main/java/sample/HelloWorld.java). To pass the required test cases you *must* implement every method exactly as specified. Do not modify the signatures of the methods provided or the names of the classes provided.

**Testing:** There is one test case you must pass for full credit.

:warning: Do **not** modify the test cases provided. 

### Hints, Notes, and Requirements (read carefully!)

1. Make use of the [Java 8 API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/) as you complete your solution. 

### Submission Requirements

1. Use the following link to create your private github repository for this assignment. The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code, test cases, and input files. [Sample 1 - SayHello](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/64f9565c84eb1d0e074e8bcd219074bf)
2. For full credit, make sure to follow all [Style Guidelines](https://github.com/CS514-F17/notes/blob/master/Admin/style.md). Points will be deducted for each violation.


### Grading Rubric

Assignment will be ungraded!

### Academic Dishonesty

Any work you submit is expected to be your own original work. If you use any web resources in developing your code you are strongly advised to cite those resources. The only exception to this rule is code that is posted on the class website. The URL of the resource you used in a comment in your code is fine. If I google even a single line of uncited code and find it on the internet you may get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class. You may also get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class if your solution is at all similar to that of any other student.
